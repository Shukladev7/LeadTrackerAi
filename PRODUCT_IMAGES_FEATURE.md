- `/src/lib/business-types.ts` - Added `productImage` field to Product interface
- `/src/lib/storage-utils.ts` - Added image upload/delete/validate functions

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Storage Structure
Images are stored in Firebase Storage at:
```
products/{uuid}-{filename}
```

### Image Metadata Structure
```typescript
{
  url: string;         // Firebase Storage download URL
  fileName: string;    // Original filename
  filePath: string;    // Storage path for deletion
  uploadedAt: string;  // ISO timestamp
}
```

### Automatic Cleanup
- When updating a product image → old image is deleted
- When removing a product image → image is deleted
- When deleting a product → all associated files are deleted
- When upload fails → cleanup happens automatically

## 🚀 Production Deployment Notes

### Firebase Storage CORS
CORS has been configured for:
- `http://localhost:9002`
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `https://localhost:9002`

**For production deployment**, update `cors.json` to include your production domain:
```json
{
  "origin": ["https://your-production-domain.com"],
  "method": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
  "maxAgeSeconds": 3600,
  "responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "x-goog-resumable"]
}
```

Then apply it:
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://studio-5063047183-aa053.firebasestorage.app
```

### Image Optimization
- Next.js automatically optimizes images using the `Image` component
- Images are served via Firebase CDN for fast delivery
- Thumbnails are generated on-the-fly by Next.js

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag images into the upload area
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual feedback during upload
- **Image Preview**: See the image before saving
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Validation**: Client-side validation for file type and size
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed uploads

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Images not displaying?
1. Check Firebase Storage rules allow read access
2. Verify CORS is properly configured
3. Check browser console for errors

### Upload failing?
1. Ensure file size is under 5MB
2. Verify file format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
3. Check Firebase Storage quota hasn't been exceeded

### CORS errors?
1. Verify `cors.json` includes your domain
2. Re-apply CORS configuration:
   ```bash
   gsutil cors set cors.json gs://studio-5063047183-aa053.firebasestorage.app
   ```

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Image Gallery View**: Add a gallery mode for products
2. **Multiple Images**: Support multiple images per product
3. **Image Cropping**: Add image cropping before upload
4. **Compression**: Compress images before upload to save storage
5. **Bulk Upload**: Upload images for multiple products at once
6. **Image Search**: Search products by image
